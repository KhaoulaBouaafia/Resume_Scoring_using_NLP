# Resume_Scoring_using_NLP

The objective of our study is to optimize the recruitment process, using Natural Language Processing. In other words, our work aims at optimizing the task of selecting the best candidates. First of all, we extracted the raw text from the resumes pre-processed it. Then, we calculated the TF-IDF score for each unigram and bigram in the database and sorted each resume by their scores for a required skill, in order to obtain the most qualified CVs for that skill.
