# Resume_Scoring_using_NLP

The objective of our study is to optimize the recruitment process and the selection of the best candidates, using Natural Language Processing. First of all, we extracted the raw text from the resumes and pre-processed it. Then, we calculated the TF-IDF score for each unigram and bigram in the database. Finally,for a required skill, we sorted each resume by their TF-IDF scores , in order to obtain the most qualified CVs for that skill.
